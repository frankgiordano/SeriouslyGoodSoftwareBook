The following program demostrates Water containers, all identical and equipped with a virtually unlimited capacity. At any given time, a
container holds a certain amount of liquid, and any two containers can be permanently connected by a pipe.

are connected, they become communicating vessels and from that time on they split equally the liquid contained in them.
