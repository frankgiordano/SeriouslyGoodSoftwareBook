/**
 * Design two classes, Grid and Appliance, representing an electrical grid and an appliance that the
 * grid can power. Each grid (or each appliance) is characterized by the maximum power it provides
 * (or absorbs). You can connect an appliance to a grid using the plugInto method, and you can turn
 * it on and off using the on and off instance methods. (Initially, any new appliance is turned off.)
 * Connecting an appliance to another grid automatically disconnects it from the first one. If turning
 * an appliance on overloads its grid, the method on must throw an exception. Finally, the
 * residualPower method of Grid returns the power thatâ€™s still available on this grid.
